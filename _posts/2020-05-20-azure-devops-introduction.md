# What's it about?
Azure DevOps is an easy and complete DevOps suite hosted & offered by Microsoft. You can also run it off line if required and independent from Azure resources. It's doesn't matter what technology or hosting platform you work with.

# Presentations
I've given a presentation about this topic during a webinar MeetUp event! You can rewatch it on demand on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHsHY1zlZdw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHsHY1zlZdw){:target="_blank"}.

You can find part of the code examples on this GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/WouterBau/Azure-DevOps-Examples](https://github.com/WouterBau/Azure-DevOps-Examples){:target="_blank"}.

> The recording is about the possibilities in 2020. Microsoft has in the meantime taken down the free build minutes due to user abuse of them. I will now also always advice to work in YAML to also have a form of GitOps.
