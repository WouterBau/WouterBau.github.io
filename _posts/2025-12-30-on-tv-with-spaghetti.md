A last random post to round up this year, but I've been recorded on [live TV](https://youtu.be/6PQbTaE7QEM?t=15){:target="_blank"}!<br />
If you look really closely, you can spot me in the crowd right at the moment when Sint Niklaas made his arrival in the city of Antwerp in 2025!

But what I really also wanted to talk about is my appearance at Techorama 2025 half a year ago with my 20 minute session on "The Spaghetti Lasagne which Aspired to be Contained Ravioli"!<br/>
I'm late to the party with this post, but I've recently noticed my lightning partner talk is also available at [Techorama TV](https://techorama.tv/collections/0f5bfc1c-c096-49f4-a538-73c60906f357/play/64d7e0b1-2f16-4aec-a1a1-aa6d42e0f697){:target="_blank"}!<br/>
Sadly it's only the last 8 minutes of the talk, but get in touch if you are interested in hearing more or having a do-over of the full talk!

This talk tells the story of refactoring an inherited .NET codebase from a tangled mess of disparate components running on outdated .NET versions ("Spaghettig Lasagna Monster") to a cleaner, modern architecture that could run in containers ("Contained Ravioli"). Also Aspire was included to create an easily testable and debuggable solution.

It's a practical tale of modernizing legacy code with good intentions into a refined, maintainable solution!
