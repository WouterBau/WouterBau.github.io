I am an application developer with an open mind and many interests and experiences. I enjoy analysing, developing and providing guidance for all kinds of applications, be they desktop, web or mobile with a DevOps point of view in mind. I have experience with C#, VB, Javascript and SQL. Besides those, I also am interested in new languages and other technologies. Besides programming, I have experience with Windows Azure, Azure DevOps, UML and design patterns. I like to learn more and more with each project I work on.

Besides all that, Iâ€™m also an avid collector of video games and comics.
I also enjoy watching horror movies and going to music concerts.
